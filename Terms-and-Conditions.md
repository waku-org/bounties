## Participant rewards

Subject to your Contribution satisfying certain criteria as Status may determine in its sole discretion, Status shall pay you a bounty (the “Bounty”). Status reserves the right to determine, in its sole discretion, whether a Contribution is eligible for a Bounty and will inform you accordingly whether it is eligible. No other reward or compensation of any kind is payable to you under these Bounty T&Cs.

If Status becomes aware of the Participant violating these Bounty T&Cs, Status may: (i) withhold, cancel or amend the amount of any Bounty that may you may be eligible for; or (ii) demand the return of any Bounty, in full or in part, made to you.

You are solely responsible for all costs and expenses incurred by you in connection with the implementation and performance of your responsibilities and obligations under these Bounty T&Cs.

If you are eligible for a Bounty, Status will pay you such Bounty in crypto-tokens. You acknowledge and take full responsibility for the reception of crypto-tokens to the wallet address provided to Status, being fully aware and informed about the risks associated with the ownership and possession of crypto-tokens, including the risk of losing access to crypto-tokens due to loss of private key(s), custodial error or your own error, risks associated with the used protocols, risk of mining attacks, risk of hacking and security weaknesses, risks associated with markets for crypto-tokens, risk of uninsured losses, risks associated with uncertain regulations and enforcement actions, risks arising from taxation, risk of an unfavourable fluctuation of the crypto-tokens and other unanticipated risks. Status is not responsible for any claims with respect to the receipt of the crypto-tokens as long as Status provides evidence that the relevant crypto-tokens have been transferred to the wallet address as provided by you to Status.
